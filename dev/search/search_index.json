make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike standard AI models that simply respond to inputs with outputs, agents actively interact with their environment in a goal-directed manner. </p> <p>Agents are built on top of large language models (LLMs). This creates a system with the knowledge and power of the base LLM, but also the ability to interact with the outside world. An AI agent can do this with the special abilites (tools) it is given. Tools allow agents to query APIs, search the internet, process images and other media, and so much more.</p>"},{"location":"core-concepts/introduction-to-agents/#core-components-of-ai-agents","title":"Core Components of AI Agents","text":"<p>You can think of an AI agent as a guided LLM with instructions, tools, and contect. LLMs like Claude and Chat-GPT act in an input / output mode where each user input leads to an LLM output. Agents seem to perform the in the same way when looking at the surface: a user sends an input (prompt) and the agent produces an output. However, under the covers there is an agent loop that is happening.</p> <p></p> <p>The agent uses its instructions, tools, and context to decide when it has enough information to fulfill its prompt.

This function takes an auth token and returns the user object based on that token.</p> <ol> <li>Your client should pass the <code>Authorization</code> header and include a JWT or other token to authenticate the user, like:</li> </ol> <p><code>Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;</code></p> <ol> <li>In your callback you should lookup the user by the token. For a JWT you might do this:</li> </ol> <pre><code>async def get_current_user_from_token(session_token: str) -&gt; Optional[User]:\n    payload = jwt.decode(session_token, SECRET_KEY)\n    user = User(\n        id=payload.get(\"sub\"),\n        email=payload.get(\"email\"),\n        name=payload.get(\"name\"),\n    )\n    return user\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>The object you return as the \"user\" is opaque. But the framework will call <code>hash</code> on it and construct and re-use a dedicated instance of your Agent class mapped to that id.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"interacting-with-agents/streamlit-dashboard/","title":"Streamlit Dashboard","text":"<p>The Agentic Streamlit Dashboard provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with your agents.

Tools can literally do anything - query any data or take any action - that you can think of.</p> <p>It is tempting to think of tools the way we think about libraries that we use in traditional code, but this is a mistake. In fact tools are the key component in the AI to computer interface.  They determine how well the LLM can interact with the world, and the fidelity with which your agent can perceive the world around it. Tools have a huge impact on the efficacy of agents, and building agents often involves a lot of time working on tools (although we are getting better \"off the shelf\" tools all the time.)</p> <p>At root, tools are exposing functions to your Agent. Using the tool calling protocol developed by OpenAI, your agent elects to call tools by generating a text block in its output, and this output is parsed by the framework and turned into the actual function call.</p> <p>Side node: The smolagents library from Huggingface promotes the idea of using  CodeAgents instead of tool calling. Some researchers have found that having your agent write code - on demand - to call functions elicits superior results than traditional tool calling. It's certainly an intriguing notion, and one that we are testing presently.</p> <p>Agentic supports providing tool functions as:</p> <ul> <li>Simple functions</li> <li>Class instance methods</li> <li>Langchain tools</li> <li>Model Context Protocol (from Anthropic) tools</li> <li>Other Agents</li> </ul> <p>Here are a few examples:</p> <pre><code>def simple_function(arg1: int, arg2: int) -&gt;:\n    \"\"\" Multiplies two numbers by a mystery factor \"\"\"\n\n    return arg1 * arg2 * 23\n\nclass FileReaderTool:\n    def get_tools(self) -&gt; list[Callable]:\n        return [\n            self.read_file,\n            self.write_file,\n        ]\n\n    def read_file(self, path: str) -&gt; str:\n        \"\"\" Returns the file at the given path \"\"\"\n        return open(path).read()\n\n    def write_file(self, path: str, content: str) -&gt; str:\n        \"\"\" Writes the provided content to the indicated path \"\"\"\n        with open(path, \"w\") as f:\n            f.write(content)\n        return \"The file was written\"\n\nagent = Agent(\n    ...\n    tools = [simple_function, FileReaderTool()]\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the docstring is required to describe each function.</p> <p>Here are some rules/guidelines for writing good tools:</p> <ul> <li>Generally we find classes and methods are a more useful form than bare functions. There aren't a lot of bare functions that are super helpful tools.</li> <li>Using classes and methods means that you can keep state in your tool (via <code>self</code>) and share it between function calls.</li> <li>The name of the function, the docstring, and the parameter names are all passed to the LLM. Function names should very clearly explain the purpose of the function.</li> <li>You can describe parameter usage (possible values, etc...) in the docstring, but often its enough to just have good parameter names.</li> <li>Try to avoid super generic function names like <code>read_file</code>, and consider prefixing  functions with a namespace, like <code>github_read_file</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Although you can always use \"plain functions\" for tools, Agentic has some special support for particular tool patterns.</p> <p>RunContext</p> <p>When your agent is started, a <code>RunContext</code> object is created and preserved through the lifetime of the run session. This object can hold arbitrary state that your agent can use during the run. Tool functions just need to define a parameter called <code>run_context</code> to receive the object when they are invoked:</p> <pre><code>    def hello_func(self, run_context: RunContext, message):\n        print(message)\n        print(\"I am running in agent: \", run_context.agent.name)\n</code></pre> <p>RunContext also offers various utility methods for getting access to system services.</p>"},{"location":"tools/#tool-return-types","title":"Tool return types","text":"<p>The most common tool simply returns a string which is provided to the LLM as the \"anwer\" to the tool call.</p> <p>However, tools can generally return any kind of object as long as it can be serialized into a string.

Agentic tries to provide some framework support to cover the most common cases:</p> <pre><code>- For config, take parameters to the `__init__` function for your tool class\n- Configure secrets in the environment, but use `run_context` to access them\n- Described required secrets by implementing the `required_secrets` method\n</code></pre> <p>Here is an example from the TavilyTool (for web search):</p> <pre><code>class TavilySearchTool:\n    def __init__(self, api_key: str = None):\n        self.api_key = api_key\n\n    def required_secrets(self) -&gt; dict[str, str]:\n        return {\"TAVILY_API_KEY\": \"Tavily API key\"}\n\n    async def query_for_news(\n        self, run_context: RunContext, query: str, days_back: int = 1\n    ) -&gt; pd.DataFrame | PauseForInputResult:\n        \"\"\"Returns the latest headlines on the given topic.\"\"\"\n\n        api_key = run_context.get_secret(\"TAVILY_API_KEY\", self.api_key)\n        ...\n</code></pre> <p>You can pass the API key to the init function, but more likely you want to configure that  key in your environment. By implementing <code>required_secrets</code> you tell the framework that your tool needs some credentials, and the framework will check that they are set, or prompt the user to supply them.</p> <p>Once your tool function is called (like 'query_for_news') then you can retrieve the secrets from the RunContext. Look at Agentic's secrets system for a description of how secrets are managed.</p>"},{"location":"tools/#using-environment-configuration","title":"Using environment configuration","text":"<p>In addition to secrets, you can store plaintext settings in your enviroment as well.

You can achieve this with the <code>PauseForInputResult</code> class:</p> <pre><code>from agentic.events import PauseForInputResult\n\n    def get_favorite_tv_show(self, run_context):\n        fave_tv = run_context.get_setting(\"tv_show\")\n        if fave_tv is None:\n            return PauseForInputResult({\"tv_show\": \"Please indicate your favorite TV Show\"})\n        else:\n            run_context.set_setting(\"tv_show\", fave_tv) # remember persistently\n        return f\"Ok, getting your favorite espiodes from {fave_tv}\"\n</code></pre> <p>The first time your function is called it determines that the required value is missing, so it returns the <code>PauseForInputResult</code> with the missing key and a message describing what it needs. The message will be shown to the user, and their response will be automatically set in the <code>run_context</code> using the indicated key. Then your function will be invoked again, but this time the setting should be available. You can choose to persist the value so that the human doesn't get interrupted again on the next run, via <code>run_context.set_setting</code>. </p> <p>If you want your agent to request \"human input\" directly, there is a convenience <code>HumanInterruptTool</code> available.</p>"},{"location":"tools/#generating-events-logging","title":"Generating Events / Logging","text":"<p>Remember that when you agent is running, it emits a stream of well-typed events. It is possible for tool functions to also generate events. In this case these events will be emitted by your agent, but they won't be revealed to the LLM. Only the actual return value from your function is returned to the LLM.</p> <p>A classic use case is generating logging events from a function:</p> <pre><code>    def long_running_function(self, run_context) -&gt; str:\n        \"\"\" Runs a long operation and returns the result. \"\"\"\n        for x in range():\n            yield ToolResult(run_context.agent_name, \"long_running_function\", f\"working on row {x})\n            ... do some work\n\n        return \"The work is done! Thanks for waiting.\"\n</code></pre> <p>Building the event is toilsome, so <code>run_context</code> has a convenience method:</p> <pre><code>yield run_context.log(\"Something interesting happened: \", param2, param2)\n</code></pre> <p>This builds and returns the <code>ToolResult</code> event for you.</p> <p>Note that this style works for synchronous functions, but not async. In the async case you need to yield the return value:</p> <pre><code>    async def long_running_function(self) -&gt; str:\n        \"\"\" Runs a long operation and returns the result. \"\"\"\n        for x in range():\n            yield run_context.log(f\"working on row {x})\n            ... do some work\n\n        yield \"The work is done! Thanks for waiting.\"\n</code></pre> <p>The generator is the right approach for true long-running tools, because otherwise your agent cannot emit any status info while the function is running. However, for short-running functions that still want to do logging, it is annoying to have to implement a generator.</p> <p>So for convenience, you can log into the <code>run_context</code> instead:</p> <pre><code>    def my_func_with_logging(self, run_context: RunContext) -&gt; str:\n        \"\"\" An interesting functions. \"\"\"\n        for x in range():\n            run_context.log(f\"working on row {x})\n            ... do some work\n\n        return \"The work is done! Thanks for waiting.\"\n</code></pre> <p>Note that we didn't <code>yield</code> the log object. After your function returns, the system will  automatically publish the <code>ToolResult</code> events from any messages logged by your function,  and then proceed to process the function result.</p> <p>Adding tools dynamically</p> <p>You can add a tool to an agent at any time:</p> <pre><code>agent.add_tool(tool)\n</code></pre> <p>and it will be availabe to the agent the next time it runs.</p>"},{"location":"tools/building-tools/","title":"Building Tools","text":"<p>This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own tools for the agentic framework.
